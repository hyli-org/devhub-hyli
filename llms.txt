# Hyli LLMs Guide (llms.txt)
# Purpose: help AI coding assistants and search indexers find and summarize Hyli docs accurately.
# Canonical site: https://docs.hyli.org
# Brand line: "Hyli is the new proof-powered L1 to build the next generation of apps."

File: /docs/index.md
Summary: Landing page. What Hyli is, why it’s different, nav cards to Guide, Quickstart, Concepts, Tooling, plus a high-level pipeline diagram and “How Hyli works”.

Key claims:
- Proof-powered L1 separating execution from verification.
- Web2 performance with Web3 trust.
- Fast settlement via native proof verification.

Primary CTAs:
- Guide: ./guide/index.md
- Quickstart: ./quickstart/index.md
- Concepts: ./concepts/index.md
- Tooling: ./tooling/index.md

---
File: /docs/guide/index.md
Summary: Non-code overview (“why/what/future”) with a timeline for quick orientation.

Related:
- Why Hyli?: ./why-hyli.md
- Core components: ./components.md
- Future: ./future.md

---
File: /docs/guide/why-hyli.md
Summary: Architectural rationale for Hyli’s design (horizontal scaling via proofs; L1 focuses on sequencing, DA, verification). Explains why scaling execution on a single chain hits limits.

---
File: /docs/guide/components.md
Summary: Core primitives: offchain execution, blob/proof transactions, Autobahn consensus; app architecture; end-to-end example (e.g., a DEX). Includes diagrams.

---
File: /docs/guide/future.md
Summary: Vision for proving networks, censorship resistance (multiple concurrent proposers), and Hyli’s focus on scaling DA and proof verification throughput.

---
File: /docs/quickstart/index.md
Summary: Entry to getting started. Single CTA should point to the unified quickstart after merge.
CTA: ./run-locally.md  (after you rename)

---
File: /docs/quickstart/run.md
Summary: Run a local node, wallet, and scaffold; includes version pinning and commands. After merge/rename, this becomes: /docs/quickstart/run-locally.md

Key refs:
- Node repo: https://github.com/hyli-org/hyli
- Explorer: https://explorer.hyli.org
- Wallet repo: https://github.com/hyli-org/wallet/
- App scaffold: https://github.com/hyli-org/app-scaffold/

---
File: /docs/quickstart/edit.md
Summary: Build your app with the scaffold (contracts, server/autoprover, front-end wiring). Consider folding into run-locally.md as “Build your app”.

---
File: /docs/concepts/index.md
Summary: Hub for Hyli concepts with cards linking to transactions, proof generation, identity, proof composition, pipelined proving, etc.

---
File: /docs/concepts/transaction.md
Summary: Two-step model (blob-transaction for intent/sequencing, proof-transaction for settlement) and structures of each. Explains why this separation improves UX and parallelism.

---
File: /docs/concepts/pipelined-proving.md
Summary: Solves base-state conflicts and long proof latencies by splitting sequencing from settlement; timeouts for unprovable blobs; diagrams included.

---
File: /docs/concepts/proof-generation.md
Summary: What to prove (public vs private inputs), where to prove (client/app/prover network), and how to choose a proving scheme. Mentions autoprover in the scaffold.

---
File: /docs/concepts/identity.md
Summary: Any app can be an identity. One identity blob per blob-transaction; nonces; how verification works; diagrams. Recommends the Hyli wallet for aggregation.

---
File: /docs/concepts/proof-composition.md
Summary: Short explainer on composing proofs across contracts and proof systems (recursion, cross-contract composition).

---
File: /docs/concepts/consensus.md
Summary: Hyli’s consensus (Autobahn), multiple concurrent proposers, DA certificates, and implications for latency and censorship resistance.

---
File: /docs/concepts/hyli-vs-vintage-blockchains.md
Summary: Differences vs EVM-style chains: no onchain execution/VM, minimal onchain state, identity abstraction (no traditional wallets), every app settles proofs, privacy built in.

---
File: /docs/tooling/index.md
Summary: Tooling overview with links to Explorer, Wallet, and API/SDK.

---
File: /docs/tooling/wallet.md
Summary: How to use the Hyli wallet (as an identity aggregator), local dev flow, basic integration steps.

---
File: /docs/tooling/api.md
Summary: API + SDK entry. Local Swagger at http://localhost:4321/swagger-ui/ and indexer docs at https://indexer.testnet.hyli.org/swagger-ui/. Lists JS and Rust SDKs.

SDKs:
- JS: https://www.npmjs.com/package/hyli
- Rust: https://crates.io/crates/hyle-client-sdk  [NOTE: confirm package name; update if “hyli-client-sdk” is now the canonical crate]

---
File: /docs/reference/index.md
Summary: Index for reference material (supported proving schemes, local node options, params, etc.).

---
File: /docs/reference/supported-proving-schemes.md
Summary: Matrix of supported schemes (e.g., RISC Zero, SP1, Noir, Cairo M…); tradeoffs and selection tips.
