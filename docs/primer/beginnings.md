# The beginnings

<!--Intro needs to be rewritten-->

The Hyli founders, Sylve and Lancelot, have built various consumer and developer-facing applications and frameworks in the Starknet ecosystem. Building fully-onchain applications led them to rethink the current limitations of blockchain and what the end-state blockchain architecture should be.

Zero-knowledge proofs had become very practical, and Starknet showed that they are the best way to scale execution.

This made them think: why does the L1 even handle execution?

Why not just sequence the transaction and verify the proofs?
