# Partnerships

We are always open to discussions with financial institutions, payment companies, and infrastructure providers building private, compliant solutions.

[Let's get in touch](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd0Xl2J5bDC7Pk-9W97klJu_etm8cZ6YbPjYb2X35CAaRojuA/viewform){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

## Stablecoin issuers & payment companies

We provide infrastructure for fintechs, neobanks, and licensed issuers to deploy MiCA-compliant private stablecoins.

## Tokenization platforms

Tokenization platforms can leverage Hyli's proof-first architecture to deliver privacy for issuers and investors while maintaining regulatory compliance through selective disclosure.

## Banking infrastructure providers

If you provide Banking-as-a-Service or embedded finance infrastructure, your clients get the benefits of blockchain settlement without exposing sensitive financial data to the public.

## Compliance & infrastructure

### Prover networks and zkVM providers

We need proving power, you have it.

The usual partnership: we integrate your zkVM or prover stack as a client, providing proof generation workloads as part of our settlement and verification pipeline.

### ZK hardware

Your hardware can accelerate proof generation for Hyli-based financial applications. We are actively exploring hardware partnerships to push latency and efficiency boundaries even further, enabling real-time compliance proof generation.

### Compliance tool integrations

Hyli is designed to integrate with existing compliance infrastructure. If you provide KYC, AML, transaction monitoring, or regulatory reporting tools, we're interested in exploring integrations that enable seamless compliance workflows for Hyli-based applications.

## European financial institutions

Banks, custodians, and asset managers exploring private digital assets: we'd like to talk.

Hyli provides the infrastructure layer for:

- Private institutional payment networks
- Confidential custody and settlement solutions
- Digital asset infrastructure with regulatory transparency
- Integration with existing banking systems and compliance frameworks

Whether you're exploring stablecoin issuance, tokenized asset settlement, or confidential payment networks, Hyli's selective disclosure architecture delivers the privacy and compliance requirements for regulated financial institutions.
