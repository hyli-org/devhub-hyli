# Partnerships

We are always open to technical and product discussions with potential partners!

[Let's get in touch](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd0Xl2J5bDC7Pk-9W97klJu_etm8cZ6YbPjYb2X35CAaRojuA/viewform){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

## Prover network / zkVM

We need proving power, you have it.

The usual partnership: we integrate your zkVM or prover stack as a client, providing proof generation workloads as part of our settlement and verification pipeline.

## RaaS (Rollup as a service)

When you integrate us as providers, your clients get:

- Ultra-fast finality via our high-throughput DA layer and shared sequencing
- Native composability across the entire Hyli ecosystem, regardless of the proof system used
- The ability to offer your clients seamless deployment of [vApps](https://x.com/SuccinctLabs/status/1915427365779628151) into production
- Significant reduction in proof-generation latency, allowing for near-instant settlement cycles

## ZK hardware

Your hardware can accelerate proof generation for Hyli-based rollups and applications. We are actively exploring hardware partnerships to push latency and efficiency boundaries even further.

## Applications

With Hyli, adding verifiable computation is straightforward: use Rust, integrate a zkVM, and deploy. We're particularly interested in supporting applications around DeFi, identity, gaming, payments, AI, zkML, and voting.

Thanks to [native signature support](../concepts/identity.md) and [flexible zkVM abstraction](../concepts/proof-composition.md), your app benefits from full onchain verifiability while retaining a familiar developer experience.

Of course, our entire docs are also here for you!

## Validator / node operator

See [community validators](../reference/node.md).
