title: Roadmap
---

Hyli is continuously evolving toward a faster, simpler, and more interoperable proof-powered network.

![The Hyli roadmap includes two testnet phases gated by an access code and one stable testnet.](../assets/img/roadmap.jpg)

## Current phase: Testnet

Our testnet is live and running.

It serves as the main environment where we experiment with new protocol features and deploy apps built on top of Hyli.

While anyone can interact with user-facing apps we occasionally release on the testnet, building directly on it isn’t open yet.

If you’re developing something that [already runs on devnet](../quickstart/index.md) and want to see it live on the testnet, reach out! We occasionally onboard selected projects manually.

Stay tuned for updates or ask specific questions [in our Telegram group](https://t.me/hyli_org).

## What we're working on

Hyli’s focus right now is on:

* **Protocol iteration** to offer the best possible blockchain.
* **Developer experience** to make integrating proofs into applications as seamless as possible.
* **Proof ecosystem expansion**, adding support for more proving schemes and proving networks.
* **Stability & scalability**, ensuring that proof verification at scale remains fast, composable, and low-latency.

## What's next

Over time, the testnet will mature into a stable, publicly usable network.
Our next milestones include:

* **Opening testnet access** to a broader range of builders.
* Deepening **integrations** across proof systems and infrastructure partners.
* Expanding **interoperability** with existing smart contract ecosystems.
* Preparing the foundation for a secure and performant **mainnet launch**.

Stay tuned on our social channels for updates or reach out if you’re building something that belongs in that future.
