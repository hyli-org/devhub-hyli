# Proof generation and submission

Hyli allows you to build unchained applications by leveraging zero-knowledge proofs. They allow you to avoid onchain execution, guarantee privacy, and customize your application while maintaining composability with other apps.

With Hyli, generate your proof wherever you prefer, then send it for native onchain verification and settlement. This process enables scalable, modular applications with customizable proving schemes.

If you're a complete beginner with zero-knowledge proofs, [our no-code introduction](https://blog.hyli.org/a-simple-introduction-to-zero-knowledge-proofs-zkp/) might help.

## Zero-knowledge proofs on Hyli

### Choose what you prove

Each application defines its proof logic. This means that each application developer can decide **what information** gets proven: for Hyli, proof settlement is a Success or a Failure. You define what that means for your app.

Each app developer also defines what the **public and private inputs** of their app will be: what information should remain private and what should go onchain?

### Choose how you prove

We support as many proving schemes we can, giving you the flexibility to choose the most suitable protocol for your specific use case. Read more about [our supported proving schemes](../reference/supported-proving-schemes.md).

We also verify these natively, without the need for a ZK proof:

- sha3_256
- BLST signatures
- Secp256k1 signatures

There are [many ZK languages](https://github.com/microbecode/zk-languages). Hyli aims to verify as many as possible.

DSLs, like Circom, are specific languages that usually compile down to a specific circuit. They're good, but they're complex and may have a high learning curve.

zkVMs prove the correct execution of arbitrary code. They allow you to build ZK applications in a certain language without having to build a circuit around it. There are two main types of zkVMs: Cairo and RISC-V. You can benchmark your Rust code and find the best zkVM for your needs with [the any-zkvm template](https://github.com/MatteoMer/any-zkvm).

We will support more types, including Cairo-based zkVMs and DSLs, in the future, and plan to support all major proving schemes eventually.

## How to generate proofs

### Choose where you prove

Each application can generate its proof in whichever place fits best.

### Autoproving through our scaffold

[Hyli’s scaffold](https://github.com/hyli-org/app-scaffold) includes a built-in AutoProver service that automatically detects transactions related to your contract. It generates the corresponding proof and submits the associated proof transaction to Hyli.

With autoproving in place, you don’t need to manage custom proving flows. Just write your contract and connect a frontend—the scaffold handles everything else.
This setup is ideal for projects where you want minimal backend setup and an easier onboarding experience.

Visit the [scaffold repository](https://github.com/hyli-org/app-scaffold) or follow [the quickstart instructions](../quickstart/run.md).

### Our proof generation partners

If you choose to work with an external prover or proving market, you can choose from one of our partners in that area and benefit from a better Hyli integration.

## Submitting a proof to Hyli

Read more about the transaction lifecycle on our [transactions overview](./transaction.md).

First, your application sends a blob transaction to Hyli.

Thanks to [pipelined proving](./pipelined-proving.md), once a transaction is submitted, it is sequenced.

You can then start generating your proof using the sequenced virtual base state as the base state for your operation.

Once sent, the proof goes through Hyli’s native verification, removing the need for verifier contracts.

Once verified, the proof is settled onchain. Use this settled state to update your app accordingly outside of Hyli.

## Handling state conflicts for proof generation

When a transaction is sequenced on Hyli, it becomes part of the pending state.

If another user submits a transaction without including the most recent pending state, their proof will fail with an `Initial state mismatch` error.

This typically happens when two users generate proofs around the same time. For example:

1. Bob and Alice both prepare a token transfer.
1. Bob’s transaction is sequenced first.
1. Alice generates her proof based on the previous state, unaware of Bob's transaction.
1. If Alice submits a state update ignoring Bob’s transaction, it will be rejected.

To avoid this, your app needs to monitor the sequencer, re-fetch the latest pending state, and re-generate the proof with all prior unsettled transactions included.

The easiest way to handle this is to **use Hyli’s AutoProver module**, included in [the scaffold](../quickstart/edit.md). The AutoProver:

- monitors the sequencer for new transactions.
- keeps track of pending state updates.
- automatically retries proof generation when state changes.

By default, AutoProver runs on a backend server. You can go serverless by embedding a lightweight version of AutoProver in your frontend, tailored to handle only the current user's transactions and retries. This will require some custom logic.
