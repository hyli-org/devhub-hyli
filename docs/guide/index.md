# 🌍 Guide

Welcome to the Hyli guide.

It is your entry point into understanding Hyli. The guide is divided into three sections and uses minimal code to serve a bigger audience.

If you want to build on Hyli, you may want to check out the [quickstart](../quickstart/index.md) or [concept pages](../concepts/index.md).
