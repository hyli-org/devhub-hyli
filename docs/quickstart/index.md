# :checkered_flag: Quickstart

Welcome to the **Quickstart** guide for Hyli.

It uses several examples to help you start building as soon as possible.

!!! information
    Hacking at **ZKHack Berlin**? Our docs are not always up to date, so we made a [ZKHack Berlin Quickstart](../zkhack.md) to make you get started much faster!

!!! failure
    This documentation is not up-to-date. We'll rewrite it soon. In the meantime, we recommend using our [testnet faucet](https://github.com/hyli-org/faucet) or [testnet wallet](https://github.com/hyli-org/wallet) as examples.
